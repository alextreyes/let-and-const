//What is the difference between var and let?
//let variables are hoisted but not initialized, unlike var, were they are initialized as undefined
//let variables are block-scope, meanwhile var variables are function-scoped or globally-scoped
//let variables cannot bet redeclared in the same scope, while var allows it

// What is the difference between var and const?
// var variables can be re-assigned and re-declared, while const cannot

//What is the difference between let and const?
// you can re-assgin with let, meanwhile const doesn't let you;

//What is hoisting?
// it's how js works, where the variables and functions are moved to the top of their respectives scopres during code compilation, before the code actually runs
